    description:
      "Most interpretations of Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians miss the point. That's because most interpretations assume that Christ abolished the Torah to remove the dividing wall of hostility between Jews and Gentiles, thereby merging both into a new Christian identity called the One New Man. In this view, the One New Man is neither Jewish nor Gentile. This collection of sermons from Torah Club author, D. Thomas Lancaster, provides readers with the missing Jewish context and concepts necessary to understand the epistle. Rather than homogenizing Jewish and Gentile identity in the body of Messiah, Paul's epistle stresses that distinction. He emphasizes the significance of the nations turning to the Messiah of Israel as evidence that God's eternal purposes are being worked out through Yeshua. This easy-to-read collection of teachings on Ephesians is practical, applicable, deeply theological, and full of surprises.",
